    <p>
      Ellie Struble is a multimedia artist who specializes in graphic design, 2D animation, 3D animation and video editing. She graduated from UNC Asheville with her B.A. in New Media, where she worked on the Highsmith Marketing team as a graphic designer. She is currently a graphic design contractor for Politac/DEN Systems. In addition to her main work, she volunteers as a graphic designer for PAW Alliance, an animal welfare non-profit.</p>
<p>Ellie spent a semester in college studying abroad in Angers, France, where she lived for six months to strengthen her language skills and fully immerse herself in the culture. The experience proved invaluable, offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that reshaped her worldview. One of her biggest dreams is to return to France and build a creative career there!</p>
